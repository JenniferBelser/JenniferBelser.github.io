<h3>Education & Background:</h3>

<div class="in-the-box" >   
    <ul>	
        <li>I graduated from the <strong>University of Delaware</strong> in 2000 with a B.A. in English.</li>
        <li>I currently work as a licensed esthetician with a specialty in laser rejuvenation and am licensed by the State of NY.</li>
        <li>Prior to working in the esthetics field, I worked in the modeling industry as a model agent and bookings editor, notably for <em>O, the Oprah Magazine</em>.</li>
        <li>I continue to be a jack of all trades where I also have a side gig working for <a href="www.soheefit.com"><strong>Sohee Lee</strong></a>, an online fitness coach, as an admin assistant and project manager where I do a lot of website management or delegation.</li>
        <li>This leads to where I am today, learning FEWD to get me to that next level and learn HTML, CSS, and JS. So far, it's out of my comfort zone and I find it challenging.</li>
